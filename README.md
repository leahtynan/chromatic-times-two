# Chromatic Times Two
Colorful landscapes that play music as a dancer moves through them

This new Unity/C# work will be chromatic in two senses of the word: the colors of rainbow and the musical scale. Musical notes — represented as colorful shapes — will form landscapes and play their song as a dancer moves through them. This concept builds off of my previous project Magic Puzzles.
